    <h4>Hello there and welcome to my website!</h4>
    <h4>I am a junior here at SU, studying magazine, news & digital journalism. I spent my first two years here as a film major in the School of Visual and Performing Arts. And before that, I held executive positions in high school for both the school newspaper/magazine and the film production club.</h4>
    <h4>My campus involvements include a biweekly film column in The Newshouse, and the satirical news page The Kumquat. Previously, I was part of the Otto the Orange mascot team for 3 full semesters.</h4>
    <h4>While my career seems like a long ways off, far beyond the summer internships I'm currently applying for, I think I would like to further what I'm doing at The Newshouse and write film reviews and essays. To have a critic position somewhere, or a job at an industry news body like Variety or The Hollywood Reporter, would be a dream.</h4>
